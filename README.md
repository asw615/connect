### How to run the website
1. Open your IDE (Visual studio code, psychopy e.g.) and open the folder with the website.

3. Type "flask run" in your terminal
4. Open up your browser and go to "http://127.0.0.1:5000/index". The link will maybe differ, but you can see the link in your terminal starting with "http://". Remember to end the link with "/index"
